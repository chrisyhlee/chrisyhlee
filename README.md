## Hello there!

### 👾 About Me

👋 My name is Chris Lee, a full stack developer with a passion to learn and grow every day. I started my professional life in the U.S Army, where I was a medic in the 82nd Airborne Division. I continued to pursue medicine after my service, but realized it was not what I was looking for. That's when I found LEARN Academy's full stack bootcamp and started my journey in programming! No regrets and have not looked back since!

🙌 I’m currently working on my portfolio, which is being built using React and Tailwind. I am also using free resources online to teach myself the basics of Angular and TypeScript, which I plan to use to create a weather app. I love building new things from scratch, so learning a new language and framework at the same time is just a bonus!

🎉 Outside of work, I spend free time with my wife and our cat! I also love to weightlift and run!
